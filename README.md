# CS_449_Project

This project is to design an app in android studio.
The app is named Quick Expense, and its overall use is to record day-to-day expenses so users can track their spending.
This idea is very common, so the niche use of my app is for those who eat out often or have similar, small, but forgettable
activities that could be easily recordered for quick look-up to enlighten users about their overall spending habits.
